# 🏠 Moscow Housing Price Prediction — Sberbank Dataset (Course Project)

## 📌 Summary

This project was completed as part of a university machine learning course. We used the **Sberbank Russian Housing Market** dataset to predict apartment sale prices in Moscow between 2011 and 2016.  

Our model achieved a **score equivalent to the actual 5th place solution** on the private leaderboard.

## 🧠 We used this opportunity to:

- Clean and structure real-world tabular data
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand pricing patterns
- Engineer features based on domain logic and spatial information
- Apply and compare machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Tune hyperparameters and reduce feature redundancy with PCA
- Build interpretable and reproducible analysis in notebooks

## 🔍 Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Dropped columns with excessive missing values or low correlation with price  
- Filled missing values using informed estimates (e.g. kitchen/living area ratios per region)  
- Fixed inconsistencies (e.g. unrealistic floor counts, invalid timestamps)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored price differences by property type (owner-occupied vs. investment)  
- Analyzed macro trends (e.g. 2015–2016 economic decline)  
- Visualized feature distributions and outliers

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new variables such as size ratios and temporal indicators  
- Encoded location data using smoothed average price per sub-area:

  \[
  \text{Encoded Price} = \left(\frac{n}{n + m}\right) \cdot \text{Local Avg} + \left(1 - \frac{n}{n + m}\right) \cdot \text{Global Avg}
  \]

### 4. Modeling
- Built separate models for each product type  
- Compared XGBoost and Random Forest performance  
- Tuned models using Bayesian optimization  
- Applied PCA to reduce multicollinearity and preserve 95% of variance

### 5. Ensembling
- Trained multiple models per segment  
- Aggregated predictions using the median  
- Applied a scaling factor to align predictions with real-world pricing levels

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Incomplete and inconsistent data across years  
- Capturing geographic pricing trends without overfitting  
- Modeling temporal shifts in economic conditions  
- Balancing accuracy with interpretability

## 🙌 Credits

- Special thanks to my teammates **Lidor Erez** and **Dvir Rehavi**  
- Together, we chose to treat this academic project as an opportunity to go beyond course expectations.  
- The greatest takeaway from this experience was the value of **collaboration** — working as a focused, aligned team made this project far more impactful than anything we could have done alone.
